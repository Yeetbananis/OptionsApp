You also believe the market incorrectly expects the price to rise, keeping IV high.  With the option currently at $5 and expected to rise to $7 based on stock price movement alone (before the IV crush), a profitable strategy could be to buy the contract now and sell it shortly after earnings are released, before the IV crush fully impacts the option price.  However, remember that options trading is inherently risky, and your prediction about market behavior might be incorrect.  Consider the potential loss if the price moves against your prediction.  You should consult a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n"
